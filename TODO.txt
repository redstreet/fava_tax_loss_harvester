display main table:
  - test cases for wash sales (can't have bought within 30 days; edge cases of 29/30/31 days)
    - date <= DATE_ADD(TODAY(), -30): is this correct?
  - will grouping by cost_date mean multiple lots with different costs on the same day be rendered
    incorrectly?
  - assert specid / "STRICT"

bells and whistles:
  - print TLH substitute (where?)
  - add wash amount to summary
  - add wash * to by commodity wash
  - use query context (dates? future and past?)
  - csv download
  - warn if price entries are older than the most recent weekday (approximation of trading day)
